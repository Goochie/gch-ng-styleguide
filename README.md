# AngularJS styleguide

*Opinionated AngularJS style guide for teams by [@billgch](//twitter.com/billgch)*


This styleguide comprises work published by toddmotto (https://github.com/toddmotto/)[Angular](//angularjs.org), 

[several talks](https://speakerdeck.com/toddmotto) and working in teams, building and structuring Angular applications.

[John Papa](//twitter.com/John_Papa) and I have discussed in depth styling patterns for Angular's structure, syntax, conventions and everything else! Thanks to those discussions, I've learned some great tips from John that have helped shape this guide. We've both created our own take of a styleguide, I urge you to [check his out](//github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) to compare thoughts.
